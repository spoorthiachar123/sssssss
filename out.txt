_______________Question_____________________
A new phone, E-Corp X1 has been announced and it is what you’ve been waiting for, all along.
You decide to read the reviews before buying it. From past experiences, you’ve figured out
that good reviews mean that the product is good 90% of the time and bad reviews mean that
it is bad 70% of the time. Upon glancing through the reviews section, you find out that the X1
has been reviewed 1269 times and only 172 of them were bad reviews. What is the probability
that, if you order the X1, it is a bad phone?
